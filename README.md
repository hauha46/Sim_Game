There are four neccessary files in this project
    1. pescriptive_output.txt is the initialization of the network
    2. descriptive_output.txt contains the output information of the network after training for n steps
    3. Training.py is file that will the train the computer base on the number of steps that we set. We currently have it trained in a loop of 10000 steps. You can change this number in this file at line 176 (10000 is the number that can be changed on this line)
    -->  for i in range(10000): 
        Run this file first and it will be trained
    4. Sim_game.py is the game itself. Run it and you can play with an already trained AI.
